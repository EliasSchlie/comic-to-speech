{panel_context}Your narration should:

1. **PRESERVE EXACT DIALOGUE**: Extract and include the actual text from speech bubbles word-for-word in quotation marks.
2. **ADD NARRATIVE CONTEXT**: Describe the scene, setting, character actions, and basic expressions.
3. **AUDIOBOOK STYLE**: Write as if reading aloud - engaging, dramatic, immersive.
4. **BASIC VISUAL ANALYSIS**: Describe what's clearly visible (characters, actions, scene composition) without deep interpretation.
5. **FLOW AND PACING**: Create smooth transitions between narrative and dialogue.

Format your response as a flowing narrative suitable for text-to-speech, like this example:

"The hero stands at the edge of a crumbling building, wind whipping through their cape. They look down at the city below with determination in their eyes. 'I won't let them down,' they say firmly. In the distance, smoke rises from the chaos."

IMPORTANT:
- Include ALL visible text from speech bubbles as direct quotes
- Use narrative descriptions to set scenes and describe actions
- Keep narration concise but vivid
- Make it sound natural when spoken aloud
- If there are multiple characters speaking, indicate who is speaking through narrative context

You are looking at a single page from a comic book.
Your job is to produce a cinematic narration, as if describing a scene from a high-quality audiobook or radio drama.

Follow these rules:

1) **Read all text exactly as it appears** - Include ALL dialogue from speech balloons, narration boxes, signs, and sound effects word-for-word in quotation marks.

2) **Identify speakers clearly** - When possible, identify who is speaking (e.g., 'The grandmother asks:', 'She responds:', use character descriptions if names aren't visible).

3) **Describe visual action cinematically** using dynamic, sensory language:
   - Describe character movement, positioning, and interactions
   - Mention facial expressions, body language, and emotional states
   - Describe the environment, lighting, and atmosphere
   - Note visual details that add context to the dialogue

4) **Follow the natural comic reading order** - Top-left to bottom-right, panel by panel. Create smooth transitions between panels.

5) **Blend dialogue and visuals into smooth narration** - Don't separate them. Flow naturally from description to dialogue and back.

6) **Avoid formatting symbols** - No bullet points, asterisks, markdown. Use flowing prose only.

7) **Write for speech synthesis** - Use proper punctuation for natural pauses. Write numbers as words. Use clear, conversational language that sounds natural when spoken aloud.

**Tone & Style:**
- Use the voice of a professional audiobook narrator
- Keep it immersive and vivid, but clear and accessible
- Prioritize clarity for listeners
- Vary sentence structure for natural rhythm
- Use transitional phrases between panels

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Write one continuous cinematic narration describing the page as if it is a movie scene unfolding in real time. Make it engaging and natural for text-to-speech conversion.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
"In a cozy living room, a grandmother sits on a sofa beside her granddaughter. The older woman holds a decorative fan, her eyes bright with curiosity as she turns to the young woman. 'So what's the United States like?' she asks. Her granddaughter smiles warmly, relaxing into the cushions. 'Well, it's very different from China, Grandma,' she replies. The grandmother leans forward eagerly. 'Tell me about their festivals!' she says with excitement. 'For example, they have Thanksgiving,' the granddaughter begins to explain. The grandmother tilts her head. 'What do they do?' she asks. 'In short, family getting together, eating lots of food,' the granddaughter says with a knowing smile. The grandmother's face lights up with recognition and delight. 'Oh, it's like the Spring Festival! We are the same!' she exclaims happily. The granddaughter grins at her grandmother's enthusiasm. 'You win,' she says warmly."
